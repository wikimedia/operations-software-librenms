## Name:

**Dapphp\Radius** - A pure PHP RADIUS client based on the SysCo/al implementation

## Author:

* Drew Phillips <drew@drew-phillips.com>
* SysCo/al <developer@sysco.ch> (http://developer.sysco.ch/php/)

## Description:

**Dapphp\Radius** is a pure PHP RADIUS client for authenticating users against
a RADIUS server in PHP.  It currently supports basic RADIUS auth using PAP,
CHAP (MD5), MSCHAP v1, and EAP-MSCHAP v2.  The current 2.5.x branch is tested
to work with the following RADIUS servers:

- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Network Policy Server
- Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Network Policy Server
- FreeRADIUS 2 and above

PAP authentication has been tested on:

- Microsoft Radius server IAS
- Mideye RADIUS Server
- Radl
- RSA SecurID
- VASCO Middleware 3.0 server
- WinRadius
- ZyXEL ZyWALL OTP

The PHP openssl extension is required if using MSCHAP v1 or v2.  For older PHP
versions that have mcrypt without openssl support, then mcrypt is used.

## Installation:

The recommended way to install `dapphp/radius` is using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).
If you are already using composer, simple run `composer require dapphp/radius` or add
`dapphp/radius` to your composer.json file's `require` section.

Standalone installation is also supported and a SPL autoloader is provided.
(Don't use the standalone autoloader if you're using Composer!).

To install standalone, download the release archive and extract to a location
on your server.  In your application, `require_once 'radius/autoload.php';` and
then you can use the class.

## Examples:

See the `examples/` directory for working examples (change the server address
and credentials to test).

## Synopsis:

	<?php

	use Dapphp\Radius\Radius;

	require_once '/path/to/radius/autoload.php';
	// or, if using composer
	require_once '/path/to/vendor/autoload.php';

	$client = new Radius();

	// set server, secret, and basic attributes
	$client->setServer('12.34.56.78') // RADIUS server address
	       ->setSecret('radius shared secret')
	       ->setNasIpAddress('10.0.1.2') // NAS server address
	       ->setAttribute(32, 'login');  // NAS identifier

	// PAP authentication; returns true if successful, false otherwise
	$authenticated = $client->accessRequest($username, $password);

	// CHAP-MD5 authentication
	$client->setChapPassword($password); // set chap password
	$authenticated = $client->accessRequest($username); // authenticate, don't specify pw here

	// MSCHAP v1 authentication
	$client->setMSChapPassword($password); // set ms chap password (uses openssl or mcrypt)
	$authenticated = $client->accessRequest($username);

	// EAP-MSCHAP v2 authentication
	$authenticated = $client->accessRequestEapMsChapV2($username, $password);

	if ($authenticated === false) {
	    // false returned on failure
	    echo sprintf(
	        "Access-Request failed with error %d (%s).\n",
	        $client->getErrorCode(),
	        $client->getErrorMessage()
	    );
	} else {
	    // access request was accepted - client authenticated successfully
	    echo "Success!  Received Access-Accept response from RADIUS server.\n";
	}

## Advanced Usage:

	// Authenticating against a RADIUS cluster (each server needs the same secret).
	// Each server in the list is tried until auth success or failure.  The
	// next server is tried on timeout or other error.
	// Set the secret and any required attributes first.

	$servers = [ 'server1.radius.domain', 'server2.radius.domain' ];
	// or
	$servers = gethostbynamel("radius.site.domain"); // gets list of IPv4 addresses to a given host

	$authenticated = $client->accessRequestList($servers, $username, $password);
	// or
	$authenticated = $client->accessRequestEapMsChapV2List($servers, $username, $password);


	// Setting vendor specific attributes
	// Many vendor IDs are available in \Dapphp\Radius\VendorId
	// e.g. \Dapphp\Radius\VendorId::MICROSOFT
	$client->setVendorSpecificAttribute($vendorId, $attributeNumber, $rawValue);

	// Retrieving attributes from RADIUS responses after receiving a failure or success response
	$value = $client->getAttribute($attributeId);

	// Get an array of all received attributes
	$attributes = getReceivedAttributes();

	// Debugging
	// Prior to sending a request, call
	$client->setDebug(true); // enable debug output on console
	// Shows what attributes are sent and received, and info about the request/response


## Requirements:

* PHP 5.3 or greater

## TODO:

- Set attributes by name, rather than number
- Vendor specific attribute dictionaries?
- Test with more implementations and confirm working
- Accounting?
