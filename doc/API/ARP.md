### `list_arp`

Retrieve a specific ARP entry or all ARP enties for a device

Route: `/api/v0/resources/ip/arp/:ip`

  - ip is the specific IP you would like to query, if this is all then you need to pass ?device=_hostname_ (or device id)
  - This may also be a cidr network, for example 192.168.1.0/24

Input:

  - device if you specify all for the IP then you need to populate this with the hostname or id of the device.

Example:
```curl
curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0/resources/ip/arp/1.1.1.1
curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0/resources/ip/arp/192.168.1.0/24
curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0/resources/ip/arp/all?device=localhost
```

Output:
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "message": "",
    "count": 1,
    "arp": [
        {
            "port_id": "229",
            "mac_address": "da160e5c2002",
            "ipv4_address": "1.1.1.1",
            "context_name": ""
        }
    ]
}
```
