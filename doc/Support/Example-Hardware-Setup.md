### Example hardware setups

The information in this document is direct from users, it's a place for people to share their 
setups so you have an idea of what may be required for your install.

To obtain the device, port and sensor counts you can run:

```mysql
select count(*) from devices;
select count(*) from ports where `deleted` = 0;
select count(*) from sensors where `sensor_deleted` = 0;
```
