### Apache
Either use SNMP extend or use the agent.

Note that you need to install and configure the Apache [mod_status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_status.html) module before trying the script.

##### SNMP Extend
1. Download the script onto the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/apache-stats.py -O /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```

2. Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py)

3. Verify it is working by running /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
(In some cases urlgrabber needs to be installed, in Debian it can be achieved by: apt-get install python-urlgrabber)

4. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend apache /etc/snmp/apache-stats.py
```

5. Restart snmpd on your host

##### Agent
[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already and copy the `apache` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

1. Verify it is working by running /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/apache
(If you get error like "Can't locate LWP/Simple.pm". libwww-perl needs to be installed: apt-get install libwww-perl)
2. On the device page in Librenms, edit your host and check the `Apache` under the Applications tab.

### BIND9 aka named

1: Create stats file with appropriate permissions:
```shell
~$ touch /var/run/named/stats
~$ chown bind:bind /var/run/named/stats
```
Change `user:group` to the user and group that's running bind/named.

2: Bind/named configuration:
```text
options {
	...
	statistics-file "/var/run/named/stats";
	zone-statistics yes;
	...
};
```

3: Restart your bind9/named after changing the configuration.

4: Verify that everything works by executing `rndc stats && cat /var/run/named/stats`. In case you get a `Permission Denied` error, make sure you chown'ed correctly.

5: Also be aware that this file is appended to each time `rndc stats` is called. Given this it is suggested you setup file rotation for it. Alternatively you can also set zero_stats to 1 in the config.

6: The script for this also requires the Perl module File::ReadBackwards. On FreeBSD this is available as p5-File-ReadBackwards and on linux as perl-File-ReadBackwards in CentOS/Redhat and libfile-readbackwards-perl Debian/Ubuntu. If it is not available, it can be installed by `cpan -i File::ReadBackwards`.

7: You may possible need to configure the agent/extend script as well.

The config file's path defaults to the same path as the script, but with .config appended. So if the script is located at `/etc/snmp/bind`, the config file will be `/etc/snmp/bind.config`. Alternatively you can also specific a config via `-c $file`.

Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables is $variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabes at either the start or end of a line are ignored.

The variables are as below.
```
rndc = The path to rndc. Default: /usr/bin/env rndc
call_rndc = A 0/1 boolean on weather to call rndc stats. Suggest to set to 0 if using netdata. Default: 1
stats_file = The path to the named stats file. Default: /var/run/named/stats
agent = A 0/1 boolean for if this is being used as a LibreNMS agent or not. Default: 0
zero_stats = A 0/1 boolean for if the stats file should be zeroed first. Default: 0 (1 if guessed)
```

If you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks
it should be.

8: On the device page in Librenms, edit your host and check `BIND` under the Applications tab.

##### SNMP Extend

1: Copy the bind shell script, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices)
```
wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/bind -O /etc/snmp/bind
```

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/bind)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend bind /etc/snmp/bind
```

4: Restart snmpd on the host in question.

##### Agent

1: [Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already and copy the script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/bind` via `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/snmp/bind -O /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/bind`

2: Run `chmod +x /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/bind`

3: Set the variable 'agent' to '1' in the config.

Further details: https://getchip.com/pages/chip

#### SNMP Extend
1. Copy the shell script to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices)
```

```
extend power-stat /etc/snmp/power-stat.sh
```
4. Restart snmpd on your host


### DHCP Stats
A small shell script that reports current DHCP leases stats.

##### SNMP Extend
1. Copy the shell script to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices)

2. Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/dhcp-status.sh)

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend dhcpstats /etc/snmp/dhcp-status.sh
```

4. Restart snmpd on your host


### EXIM Stats
SNMP extend script to get your exim stats data into your host.

##### SNMP Extend
1. Copy the [exim stats](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/exim-stats.sh) to `/etc/snmp/` (or any other suitable location) on your host.

2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x /etc/snmp/exim-stats.sh`

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:
```
extend exim-stats /etc/snmp/exim-stats.sh
```

4. If you are using sudo edit your sudo users (usually `visudo`) and add at the bottom:
```
snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/exim-stats.sh, /usr/bin/exim*
```

5. Restart snmpd on your host


### Fail2ban
#### SNMP Extend
1: Copy the shell script, fail2ban, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/fail2ban -O /etc/snmp/fail2ban)

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/fail2ban)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend fail2ban /etc/snmp/fail2ban
```

4: Edit /etc/snmp/fail2ban to match the firewall table you are using on your system. You should be good if you are using the defaults. Also make sure that the cache variable is properly set if you wish to use caching. The directory it exists in, needs to exist as well. To make sure it is working with out issue, run '/etc/snmp/fail2ban -u' and make sure it runs with out producing any errors.

5: Restart snmpd on your host

6: If you wish to use caching, add the following to /etc/crontab and restart cron.
```
*/3    *    *    *    *    root    /etc/snmp/fail2ban -u 
```

7: Restart or reload cron on your system.

In regards to the totals graphed there are two variables banned and firewalled. Firewalled is a count of banned entries the firewall for fail2ban and banned is the currently banned total from fail2ban-client. Both are graphed as the total will diverge with some configurations when fail2ban fails to see if a IP is in more than one jail when unbanning it. This is most likely to happen when the recidive is in use.

If you have more than a few jails configured, you may need to use caching as each jail needs to be polled and fail2ban-client can't do so in a timely manner for than a few. This can result in failure of other SNMP information being polled.

```
extend osupdate /etc/snmp/os-updates.sh
```

4. Restart snmpd on your host

_Note_: apt-get depends on an updated package index. There are several ways to have your system run `apt-get update` automatically. The easiest is to create `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic` and pasting the following in it: `APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";`.
If you have apticron, cron-apt or apt-listchanges installed and configured, chances are that packages are already updated periodically.

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) and add:
```
extend phpfpmsp /etc/snmp/phpfpm-sp
```
5: Edit /etc/snmp/phpfpm-sp to include the status URL for the PHP-FPM pool you are monitoring.
6. Restart snmpd on your host

It is worth noting that this only monitors a single pool. If you want to monitor multiple pools, this won't do it.

### Pi-hole
#### SNMP Extend

1: Copy the shell script, pi-hole, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/pi-hole -O /etc/snmp/pi-hole)

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/pi-hole)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend pi-hole /etc/snmp/pi-hole
```

4: To get all data you must get your API auth token from Pi-hole server and change the API_AUTH_KEY entry inside the snmp script.

5: Restard snmpd.

3: Make the scripts executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed /etc/snmp/postfix-queues)

4: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend mailq /etc/snmp/postfix-queues
extend postfixdetailed /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed
```

5: Restart snmpd.

6: Install pflogsumm for your OS.

7: Make sure the cache file in /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed is some place that snmpd can write too. This file is used for tracking changes between various values between each time it is called by snmpd. Also make sure the path for pflogsumm is correct.

8: Run /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed to create the initial cache file so you don't end up with some crazy initial starting value.
Please note that each time /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed is ran, the cache file is updated, so if this happens in between LibreNMS doing it then the values will be thrown off for that polling period.


### Postgres
#### SNMP Extend
1: Copy the shell script, postgres, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/postgres -O /etc/snmp/postgres)

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/postgres)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend postgres /etc/snmp/postgres
```

4: Restart snmpd on your host

5: Install the Nagios check check_postgres.pl on your system.

6: Verify the path to check_postgres.pl in /etc/snmp/postgres is correct.

7: If you wish it to ignore the database postgres for totalling up the stats, set ignorePG to 1(the default) in /etc/snmp/postgres. If you are using netdata or the like, you may wish to set this or otherwise that total will be very skewed on systems with light or moderate usage.


### PowerDNS

`apt install libpve-apiclient-perl`

2. Download the script onto the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices)
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms-agent/master/agent-local/proxmox -O /usr/local/bin/proxmox`

3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/proxmox`

4. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:
`extend proxmox /usr/local/bin/proxmox`
(Note: if your snmpd doesn't run as root, you might have to invoke the script using sudo. `extend proxmox /usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/bin/proxmox`)

5. Restart snmpd on your host


### Raspberry PI
SNMP extend script to get your PI data into your host.

##### SNMP Extend
1. Copy the [raspberry script](https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/blob/master/snmp/raspberry.sh) to `/etc/snmp/` (or any other suitable location) on your PI host.

2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x /etc/snmp/raspberry.sh`

3. Edit your snmpd.conf file (usually `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`) and add:
```
extend raspberry /etc/snmp/raspberry.sh
```

4. Edit your sudo users (usually `visudo`) and add at the bottom:
```
snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/raspberry.sh, /usr/bin/vcgencmd*
```

5. Restart snmpd on PI host


### SMART
#### SNMP Extend
1: Copy the Perl script, smart, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/smart -O /etc/snmp/smart)

2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/smart)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend smart /etc/snmp/smart
```

4: You will also need to create the config file, which defaults to the same path as the script, but with .config appended. So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/smart, the config file will be /etc/snmp/smart.config. Alternatively you can also specific a config via -c.

Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables is $variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabes at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Any line with out a = or # are treated as a disk.
```
#This is a comment
cache=/var/cache/smart
smartctl=/usr/bin/env smartctl
ada0
ada1
```

The variables are as below.
```
cache = The path to the cache file to use. Default: /var/cache/smart
smartctl = The path to use for smartctl. Default: /usr/bin/env smartctl
```

If you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks
it should be. This will result in a usable config, but may miss some less common disk devices.

5: Restart snmpd on your host

If you have a large number of more than one or two disks on a system, you should consider adding this to cron. Also make sure the cache file is some place it can be written to.
```
 */3 * * * * /etc/snmp/smart -u
```

### Squid

#### SNMP Proxy

1: Enable SNMP for Squid like below, if you have not already, and restart it.

```
acl snmppublic snmp_community public
snmp_port 3401
snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
snmp_access deny all
```

2: Restart squid on your host.

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add, making sure you have the same community, host, and port as above:
```
proxy -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1:3401 1.3.6.1.4.1.3495
```

### TinyDNS aka  djbdns

##### Agent
[Install the agent](Agent-Setup.md) on this device if it isn't already and copy the `tinydns` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

_Note_: We assume that you use DJB's [Daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) to start/stop tinydns.
And that your tinydns instance is located in `/service/dns`, adjust this path if necessary.

1. Replace your _log_'s `run` file, typically located in `/service/dns/log/run` with:
```shell
#!/bin/sh
exec setuidgid dnslog tinystats ./main/tinystats/ multilog t n3 s250000 ./main/
```

2. Create tinystats directory and chown:
```shell
mkdir /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
chown dnslog:nofiles /service/dns/log/main/tinystats
```

3. Restart TinyDNS and Daemontools: `/etc/init.d/svscan restart`
   _Note_: Some say `svc -t /service/dns` is enough, on my install (Gentoo) it doesn't rehook the logging and I'm forced to restart it entirely.

### Unbound

Unbound configuration:

```text
# Enable extended statistics.
server:
        extended-statistics: yes
        statistics-cumulative: yes

remote-control:
        control-enable: yes
        control-interface: 127.0.0.1

```

Restart your unbound after changing the configuration, verify it is working by running 'unbound-control stats'.

##### Agent
[Install the agent](#agent-setup) on this device if it isn't already and copy the `unbound.sh` script to `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/`

##### SNMP Extend

1: Copy the shell script, unbound, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/unbound -O /etc/snmp/unbound)

2: Make the scripts executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/unbound)

3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:
```
extend unbound /etc/snmp/unbound
```

4: Restart snmpd.
